# DriveWell: Revolutionizing Driver Wellness and Safety Through Smart Mobility
Driving is a daily necessity for millions, yet it comes with inherent risks. Most safety measures today focus solely on the vehicle. But what about the driver?

Key Challenges:

Fatigue and Stress: Long hours behind the wheel lead to fatigue and reduced concentration. Fatigue alone contributes to over 20% of road accidents worldwide.
Health Neglect: Drivers often ignore warning signs like elevated heart rates, leading to severe consequences like heart attacks or strokes while driving.
Reactive Systems: Current safety systems only act after a mishap occurs. There’s an urgent need for proactive solutions.

The Current Gap:
Current systems rarely offer a way to track or reward safe driving behavior
lack of spatial awareness contributes to accidents in high-traffic areas or in low-visibility conditions 
Safety systems react only after a problem occurs.
There’s an urgent need for proactive, health-focused interventions to save lives.
