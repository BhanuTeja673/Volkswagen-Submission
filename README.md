# SafeDrive

Distracted Driving is a huge problem in the current day. Introducing SafeDrive. SafeDrive's main feature is that it uses your phoneâ€™s camera to detect the distance you are from objects around you such as cars in front of you and passing by you. With additional safety features like a comprehensive accident checklist and statistics to collision warnings, hard brakes and average speed, SafeDrive provides assistance and accountability for all kinds of drivers.

# MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

* User Authentication (Name, Email, DOB, SSN)
* Camera tracking of the distance of objects nearby and primarily in front of the vehicle
* Accountability system (Statistics over time)
* Tracking Speed, Hard Brakes, Phone-In-Hand (if not using camera tracking) and other distracted driving features

# Stretch Goals

* Record while driving and act as a dash cam
* OCR for insurance and license info
* Badges and leveling up
* License and Vehicle registration information
* User-based crowd-sourced navigation information
* Potential interfaced with Google Maps for routing while in Camera Mode

# Milestones
Frontend AND Backend
  - Decide on the tech stack
  - Download and set up environments
  - Spend time looking at potential APIs for features 
  - Code test files in the chosen language and upload to the repository's test branch
  - Establish communication between team members and sub-teams
  
* Frontend
  - Research Vehicle-based app design
  - Use Figma to draw up wireframes and edit until a finalized look is reached. Make wireframes interactive.
  - Learn the basics of Flutter/Dart or Swift
  - Code design from final wireframes in an Object-Oriented manner
  - Integrate frontend with backend collectively after frontend is completely done with all pages
  
* Backend
  - Research Firebase and SQL databases
  - Learn the basics of Firebase/SQL (If SQL is chosen)
  - Learn APIs and OpenCV or alternate object detection software
  - Set up a database and database methods to store the information that the user enters
  - Set up a camera feature focusing on image output and detection of objects from those images
  - Integrate frontend and backend to display data that relies on database storage

# Tech Stack
* Wireframing: Figma
* IDE: Android Studio or VSC
* Frontend: Flutter
  * Flutter provides a lot of built-in UI components and is easier for cross-compatibility
* Backend: Firebase/Firestore OR SQL and OpenCV or Amazon Sagemaker with Dart in Flutter
  * Firebase handles flat data and simple queries very well, while Firestore handles more complex data and advanced queries better
  * SQL is more commonly used in the industry and makes simple data easy to use at larger amounts
  * OpenCV is a computer vision library to handles the object detection portion.
  * Amazon Sagemaker can be used to train a model quickly to handle the detection of the backs of vehicles and or license plate information
